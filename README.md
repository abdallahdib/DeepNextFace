# DeepNextFace
DeepNextFace is a 3D face reconstruction library from a single monocular RGB image via deep convolutional neural networks and differentiable ray tracing. It achieves fast, robust and stable 3D face reconstruction. From a single RGB image, DeepNextFace estimates face geometry, spatially-varying skin reflectance (diffuse and specular albedos), scene light and head pose.
